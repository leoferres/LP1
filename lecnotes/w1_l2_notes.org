** Lecture

 - Linux
   - Unix-like computer operating system first released on 5 October
     1991 (Linus Torvalds), as of Feb 2015, 67.8% of web servers run
     Linux
     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems)
   - I use the Xubuntu distro, you have Ubuntu there. Difference is
     the software desktop environment (xfce for Xubuntu, Unity for the
     GNOME desktop environment developed by Canonical Ltd for
     Ubuntu). Basically the same... xfce is leaner, in my
     view. Besides this, not much diff.
   - Philosophy of Unix/Linux -> have small programs that may
     compose. There are tons. See the console below.
   - We don't talk much about the OS... not necessary at this stage.

 - The console:
   - xterm is the standard terminal emulator for the X Window System
     (you can compile it yourself, fun and interesting!).
   - Used to "talk" to the computer through commands.
   - We use the embedded ubuntu terminal (xfce-terminal, =Ctrl-Alt t=)
   - This is the list of *essential shell commands* we will see here:
     =ls=, =cd=, =cp=, =mv=, =mkdir=, =rm=, =cat=, =less=, =man=
     (mostly file handling programs).
   - This is the way you tell the computer to do stuff.
   - =Ctrl-Shift t= opens a new terminal tab. Do it.
   - Two more commands: =irssi=, =git=
     - irssi is a chat system. We will use it in class to "keep in
       touch": do ask, point out errors, things you don't
       undertand/I'm not being clear, etc. This is a learning tool!!
       - irssi, /connect azu.inf.udec.cl, /join lp1 (and say hello!)
     - git: versioning system. really hard for noobs.
       - you only need to know the basics: =git clone
         https://github.com/leoferres/lp1.git=, =git pull=, and that's
         pretty much it unless you want to request a pull to change
         stuff --> I'd be more than happy.
       - Notice difference between =git= and =github= (see slide)
   - now, clone the lp repo, and do the exercises in
     =exercises/w1_ex1.org= (navigate using the console!)

 - Emacs:
   - *REALLY HARD*: but you'll get used to it. Don't give up now, tho,
     you wimps.
     - Open a file,
     - Save a file,
     - Basic navigation,
     - Set mark, copy, cut and paste,
     - Show undo and kill ring,
     - Show C-g,
     - Show search and replace,
     - Split window and move to other window,
     - Switch to other buffers,
     - DO THE TUTORIAL!!! =C-h t=
     - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/311221/what-to-teach-a-beginner-in-emacs

 - C: the topic of this course... we won't say much about it right
   now, 'cept at the end. We will compile our first code!

 - gcc: GNU Compiler Collection
   - we will compile and run our first C program today!!!
     - Open emacs, open file =hello.c= and write:
       #+BEGIN_SRC C
       #include <stdio.h>
       int main() {
         printf("Hola, mundo!!"); // in Spanish, because reasons.
       }
       #+END_SRC
     - save the file.
     - then do: =gcc hello.c -o hello=, and finally execute as
       =./hello=.

** Next class

Read the tutorial part of the K&R book (first chapter). Copies in
Spanish in the library.
