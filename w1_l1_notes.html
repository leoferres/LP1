<li><b>Introduction</b>: This is the first "real" Computer Science course
in the CS degree at UdeC. My name is Leo Ferres, but you can
call me Leo. Started programming at 9 yo in Argentina on a CZ
1500 (clone of the Timex Sinclair 1500, the "American" version
of the ZX81, plus expansion to 16Kb). My mom then bought me a
48Kb TK90X, a Brazilian clone of the British ZX Sepctrum, but
that's another story. Moved to Canada to do my PhD, and arrived
in Chile in 2008. I do research on HPC, parallel algorithms, and
social network analysis.

<p>
The objective of this course is to give you the most basic
conceptual tools you need to understand programming. However,
this is not your run-o'-the-mill, vanilla, Java-ish programming
course. It will not teach you (many) good practices of software
engineering, nor will it teach you how to be a good programmer
(who could in a Semester, anyway). What it will do is teach you
to understand how a computer does what you tell it to do through
a computer programming language. Programming is not black magic,
and computers are not black boxes, my job in this course is to
make both transparent.
</p>

<p>
We will use C, but the syntax is irrelevant. I could have picked
any programming language. However, C gives me the control I need
and it is lean enough to teach you the concepts I want to teach
you. In fact, if I am successful teaching you those concepts, at
the end of this courseyou will be able to easily learn any
computer syntax with minimum effort (well, maybe not
Prolog&#x2026; but still).
</p>

<p>
We will try to teach you, through exercises, some problem
solving skills. Collaboration is allowed on assignments, but the
final report is up to you. (See below). I will try to tell you
some compsci/programming history along the way. We have a great
discipline, with some great stories to tell.
</p>

<p>
Aaaaand, we have lots of awesome geeky tools to learn that will
make you a H4x0r (leet speak).

<li><b>Administration</b>:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Evaluation

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exams: really hard, study hard!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>even if 60/40, avg is not weighted
</li>
<li>you do not pass the exams, you do not pass the class, no
matter what other marks you have.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Assignments:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you do not pass the assignments, you do not pass the
class, no matter what other marks you have.
</li>
<li>lab exam: I think this year they will all be lab exams. I
still need to figure out the logistics, but it will have
to do with google forms (check them out if you want).
</li>
<li>you can collaborate, document is an individual project
(must show me you understood).
</li>
<li>details on how to submit are TBA (will prob change this
year)
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>class participation: measured on your contributions in
Piazza. at the end, the 10 most active contributors get 2%.
</li>

<li>bonus 1% if you transcribe a lecture, but only if you've
passed the course (so, only to improve your final mark).

We will be working with some new tools! Check out Linux (Xubuntu), the
xfce terminal, emacs, github, irssi (irc). URLs in slides.
